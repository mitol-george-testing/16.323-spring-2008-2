Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Objectives
----------

*   Nonlinear optimization – MATLAB implementation
*   Optimization approaches: dynamic programming, Calculus of Variations
*   Linear quadratic and _H∞_ compensators – stochastic and deterministic
*   Investigate key basic control concepts and extend to advanced algorithms (MPC)
*   Will focus on both the technique/approach and the control result

Approximate Number of Lectures per Topic
----------------------------------------

### Keywords

LQR = linear-quadratic regulator  
LQG = linear-quadratic Gaussian  
MPC = model predictive control

| NUMBER OF LECTURES | TOPICS |

Grades
------

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Homework: problem sets every other Thursday due 2 weeks later (usually) at 11 am | 20% |
| Two midterms: both are in class, and you are allowed 1 sheet of notes (both sides) for the first, 2 sheets for the second | 25% each |
| Final exam | 30% 

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Course assumes a good working knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations. New material will be covered in depth in the class, but a strong background will be necessary.
*   Solid background in control design is best to fully understand this material, but not essential.
*   Course material and homework assume a good working knowledge of MATLAB.

Policies
--------

*   You are encouraged to discuss the homework and problem sets. **However, your submitted work must be your own.**
*   Late homework will not be accepted unless prior approval is obtained from Professor How. Grade on all late homework will be reduced 25% per day. No homework will be accepted for credit after the solutions have been handed out.
